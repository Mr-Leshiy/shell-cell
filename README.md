# **Shell-Cell**

Lightweight CLI tool that turns simple YAML blueprints into instant, isolated, and reproducible containerized development shell sessions.

## 💡 How It Works

**Shell-Cell** reads a `scell.yml` blueprint, compiles it into a image, and launches a persistent container that acts as a "shell server". You can then attach interactive shell sessions to this warm, ready-to-use environment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

A running [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (or [Podman](https://podman.io/)) daemon is required.

### Install

- Build for Unix 
<!-- cspell: disable -->
```shell
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Mr-Leshiy/shell-cell/releases/latest/download/shell-cell-installer.sh | sh
```
<!-- cspell: enable -->

- Build from source (any platform)
```shell
cargo install shell-cell --locked
```

For socket configuration and other setup details, see the [Install and Configure](https://mr-leshiy.github.io/shell-cell/install) guide.

### Create a Blueprint

Run `scell init` to generate a minimal `scell.yml` in your project directory:

```shell
scell init
```

Or write one by hand (see the full [Blueprint Reference](https://mr-leshiy.github.io/shell-cell/blueprint) for all available instructions):

```yml
main:
  from_image: debian:bookworm
  workspace: /app
  shell: /bin/bash
  hang: while true; do sleep 3600; done
```

### Launch a Session

```shell
scell
```

That's it! **Shell-Cell** will find the `scell.yml` in your current directory, build the environment, and drop you into an interactive shell. For more CLI options and usage patterns, see the [CLI Reference](https://mr-leshiy.github.io/shell-cell/cli).
